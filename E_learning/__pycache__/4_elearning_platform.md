# E-Learning Platform - Detailed Implementation

## Key Features

- Course creation and management for instructors
- Lesson organization with various content types (video, text, quiz)
- Student enrollment and progress tracking
- Quizzes and assignments with automatic grading
- Discussion forums for each lesson
- Course ratings and reviews
- Analytics dashboards for both instructors and students
- Certificate generation upon course completion

## Core Models

The platform uses several interconnected models:

```python
# Core models
class Category(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)
    slug = models.SlugField(unique=True)

class Course(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    description = models.TextField()
    instructor = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='courses')
    category = models.ForeignKey(Category, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='courses')
    thumbnail = models.ImageField(upload_to='course_thumbnails/')
    level = models.CharField(max_length=15, choices=LEVEL_CHOICES, default='beginner')
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2, default=0.00)
    is_free = models.BooleanField(default=True)

class Lesson(models.Model):
    course = models.ForeignKey(Course, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='lessons')
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    content_type = models.CharField(max_length=15, choices=CONTENT_TYPE_CHOICES)
    content = RichTextField(blank=True)  # For text-based lessons
    video_url = models.URLField(blank=True)  # For video lessons
    order = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    is_preview = models.BooleanField(default=False)  # Free preview lesson

class Enrollment(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='enrollments')
    course = models.ForeignKey(Course, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='enrollments')
    enrollment_date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    completed = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

## Visual Overview

Here's how the key pages would look:

### Course Listing Page


This page displays available courses with filtering options by category, level, and price. Each course card shows:
- Course thumbnail

### Lesson View

The lesson page features:

### Student Dashboard

Students can:
- View enrolled courses
- Track progress through course completion percentages

- See quiz scores and assignment grades

### Instructor Dashboard

Instructors can:
- Manage their courses
- Create new content

- Monitor course ratings and reviews
- Track student progress
- Generate reports on course performance

## Example Implementation of Key Views


```python
class CourseDetailView(DetailView):
    model = Course
    template_name = 'courses/course_detail.html'
    
    def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
        context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
        course = self.get_object()
        
        # Check if user is enrolled
        is_enrolled = False
        if self.request.user.is_authenticated:
            is_enrolled = Enrollment.objects.filter(
                user=self.request.user, 
                course=course
            ).exists()
        
        # Get preview lessons
        preview_lessons = course.lessons.filter(is_preview=True)
        
        context.update({
            'is_enrolled': is_enrolled,
            'preview_lessons': preview_lessons,
            'avg_rating': course.average_rating(),
            'total_students': course.total_enrollments(),
        })
        
        return context
```

## Advanced Features

For a more comprehensive platform, you could implement:

1. **Quiz System**: Create interactive quizzes with multiple question types and automatic grading
2. **Certificate Generation**: Generate PDF certificates when students complete courses
3. **Discussion Forums**: Allow students to discuss lessons and ask questions
4. **Progress Tracking**: Track which lessons a student has completed and overall course progress
5. **Analytics**: Provide instructors with insights about student engagement and course performance
